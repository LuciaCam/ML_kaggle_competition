    "For the boosted trees, an additional parameter is indicated. The learning rate ($\\lambda$) adjusts the size of the tree at a certain rate for this it is called a *slow learner*. The `learning_rate` is  avalue between 0 and 1 and in finding the best model we indicate various values of this new parameter. Additionally, `max_depth` changes the number of splits done in the tree. As seen from regular trees, the number of nodes affects the prediction accuracy on all sets, so finding the most appropriate one is also important."
